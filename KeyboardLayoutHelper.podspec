Keyboard layout constraint class to help adapt UIView to the appearing keyboard, so the textfields dont get lost underneath it. Usage is very simple, just apply the KeyboardLayoutConstraint class to the bottom constraint of UIView or its subclass and the view will move up and down with the keyboard.
